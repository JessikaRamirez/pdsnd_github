### Date created

October 2021 

### Project Title

BikeShare Data 

### Description

In this project, the Python tool was used to explore data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York and Washington related to bike sharing, providing the user with an interactive experience over the data and visualizing descriptive statistics about the data.

### Request

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

    total travel time
    average travel time

#4 User info

    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Libraries used

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more

pandas es una biblioteca de c칩digo abierto con licencia BSD que proporciona estructuras de datos y herramientas de an치lisis de datos de alto rendimiento y f치ciles de usar para el lenguaje de programaci칩n Python.

### Files used
For this project, three files were used, one for each of the states mentioned above, with information from January to June, all in .csv format. 

the three files have 6 columns (Start time, End time, trip duration, start station, end station and user type) and two additional columns (Gender and birth year) that apply only to Chicago and New York
